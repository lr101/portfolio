## About Me

I’m a computer science student from **Germany**, currently working on my master thesis. 
I’ve worked on a bunch of projects in backend and web development, as well as developed some apps for my own use cases. I love tinkering with Raspberry Pis and my homelab setup. 
I am currently working as a working student in cybersecurity and am trying to apply my knowledge from there to improve my homelab setup.

This is a rough overview on how I feel like my progression has gone in computer science from my POV:

{{% steps %}}

### 2015 - Start to my coding journey

I did my first baby steps during high school without a teacher -- just trying to rebuild my swim teams website, create a mobile app to track my swim progression or tinker with raspberry pis and ds18b20 sensors.

### 2017 - Computer Science in High School

I learned Java as my first programming language in school. My final project was a 3D flappy birds game in Gloop hahaha.

### 2020 to 2026 - Computer Science Bachelor & Master

I had a lot of fun studying and I learned a lot about the basics of computer science. But my focus even in that time was working on my own projects between classes.


### 2025 - SecOps working-student

My first job in cybersecurity!
