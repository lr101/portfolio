## About Me

I’m a computer science student from Germany, currently working on my master thesis. 

I’ve worked on a bunch of projects in backend and web development, as well as developed some apps for my own use cases. I love tinkering with Raspberry Pis and my homelab setup. 

I am currently working as a working student in cybersecurity and am trying to apply my knowledge from there to improve my homelab setup.


## My Projects

Go to the [project page](/projects) to see all the different projects I have worked on and am confident in sharing them publicly ;).

Here are some I would like to feature:

  {{< card link="/projects/2-homelab/" title="Homelab" image="/images/homelab.png" subtitle="My Homelab setup, used by me and my family." >}}
  {{< card link="/projects/3-temppi/" title="Tempserver" image="images/temppi.png" subtitle="Server for storing and managing ds18b20 and dh11 sensor information and values.">}}

## Blog

Check out my blog. I write about my projects, implementation details and tutorials on how I did setup my homelab.
